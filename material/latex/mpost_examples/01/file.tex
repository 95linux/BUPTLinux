MetaPost is a variant of Donald E. Knuth's METAFONT. It was created by John D. Hobby, who writes:

The MetaPost system implements a picture-drawing language very much like Knuth's METAFONT except that it outputs PostScript commands instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps. MetaPost is a powerful language for producing figures for documents to be printed on PostScript printers. It provides easy access to all the features of PostScript and it includes facilities for integrating text and graphics.
